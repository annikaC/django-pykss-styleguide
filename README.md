django-pykss-styleguide
======

Originally developed for Open Utility's internal styleguide.

This is a starting point for your own internal pykss-based styleguide. 
Using pykss's auto generated documentation, a structured index is created with pages for each section.

Also included is a styleguideblock template. 

Copy, fork, override, have fun!

Please refer to the KSS syntax for getting this to work with your CSS.

Requirements: 
pykss
